# DLQF Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is tailored for the DLQF (Digital Lab for Quantitative Finance) website.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the DLQF website in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the website for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you need more control over the build configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

It will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into your project. After ejecting, all commands except `eject` will continue to work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to fully customize your setup. At this point, you're on your own.

Ejecting is optional. The default configuration is optimized for small to medium deployments, so you may not need to eject.
